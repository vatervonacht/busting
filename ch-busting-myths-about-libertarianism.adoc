= Busting the Myths About Libertarianism

Statists are very quick to dismiss libertarianism, but few statists, if any,
spend much time studying libertarian ideas in depth. It seems odd that, even
when presented with the opportunity to take a fresh look at the question of the
state versus the individual, a statist wouldn’t first explore libertarian ideas
before reaching a definitive conclusion.  It’s almost as if the statist is
afraid of what he might discover.

Due to their lack of substantive knowledge about libertarianism, statists
subscribe to a number of myths about this political philosophy. There is a very
rich body of intellectual work that composes the libertarian philosophy and
which can answer all of the usual questions statists pose but which, sadly, is
mostly unexplored by statists.


This section is not intended to be a treatise on how a libertarian world might
operate. That could be the subject of an entire paper in and of itself and has
been the subject of much intellectual writing in the libertarian sphere (a
sample of which is contained in the <<reading-guide>> at the end of this paper).
This section is merely intended to try to address some of the most common myths
about libertarianism, and to whet the appetite of the intellectually curious
reader who wants to learn more about how a libertarian society might function
(in which case the books listed in the Reading Guide would be a good next
step).
